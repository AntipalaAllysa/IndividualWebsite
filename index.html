		<div><center>Hi!!! I am Allysa (pronounced as A-li-sa) Antipala, usually called Asylla by my classmates. Sixteen years of age and currently studies in Univerity of the Philippines. 
		<br>Jadine, BTS, and a lot more things ,you wouldn’t want to know about, 
			makes up 80% of my day while the remaining 20% is just the things that lazy people like me does. 
		<br>I look like Nemo (according to Britney Malaque)and I laugh like crazy and like to hug people whenever I have the chance.
		<br>Ice cream, yogurt and Queen Mani are just some of the foods that I love to eat.
		<br><br> Most of the time, I just sit in front of my laptop, watching videos of BTS making fun of themselves in public and reading fanfictions.
		<br> My bias is V , a.k.a. Mr Gucci-who-have-killed-me-a-million-times-with-his-smile, but I love and adore all the members of BTS. I am one of those
			fans who are unlucky because they were not born in Korea so they just have to be content with watching their boys in their desktop. 
		<br><br>Anyways, welcome to my world!

									<strong>Out of all the songs BTS had released, this one is my favorite song so far. 고엽. This can <br>be translated into Dead Leaves or Autumn Leaves. One might think that it means the same thing
									<br>however commonly used term for autumn leaves is 낙엽 (nak-yeop), which makes you imagine<br>colourful autumn leaves while the actual title, 고엽 (Dead Leaves), means dry dead leaves that
									<br>signals the start of winter. The song talks about lost love and time, the dead leaves are metaphors of
									<br>the things they have lost and forgotten.</strong>

                                <p> James Reid and Nadine Lustre, also known as JaDine, is one of the most famous love teams here in the Philippines. 
								Robert James Reid is the seventh child of an Aussie and a Filipina while Nadine is the eldest out of 4 siblings. 
								It was the very first time in my life that I was interested about Filipino artists. 
								I really didn’t take notice of any Filipino actors and actresses because I am not a big fan of Philippine movies or dramas but when I saw their movie, 
								Talk Back and You’re Dead, I was immediately attracted to them. 
								JaDine’s chemistry on and off the camera was just adorable that I can’t help but fall for these two. 
								They were not good actors at first but I saw that they have room for improvement.
								<br><br>JaDine gave me many first times. First, I actually bought magazines to show my support( I think I have 15). 
								Even if I don’t have money, I still buy magazines because I just can’t accept the fact that I can’t have a copy of those. 
								For the first time, I bought an album. I really had to fight my way through many fans just to get a signed copy of James’ album.
								Also for the first time, I waited under the rain just to hear them sing and ran around Ayala 
								like a crazy person in order to see a glimpse of them. I even gave up sleep just to be updated of there whereabouts. And 
								I can still remember the night that I cried because my mother would not allow me to go to their concert. Yes, I was a die-hard 
								fan. Every morning and night, I immediately checked JaDine’s social accounts, hoping that they post something.
								I still remember the moment I saw James saying “I love you”, <strong>I really cried</strong>.
								<br><br>I don’t know why I liked them, maybe it’s due to the fact that I have the same birthday with James Reid or 
								that Nadine is a very kind and lovable person, but they gave me inspiration to give my best in the things that 
								I do and be content of what I have. Even though these days I am not a die-hard fan as I was before, I will never 
								forget JaDine and the moments that they made me happy.</p>

								<p><center>
								Bangtan Sonyeondan, a.k.a the seven boys who ruined my life (in a good way), show their love to their fans through very simple 
								yet admirable ways. Always being active in their Twitter account, sharing to the fans their thoughts and favorite moments, 
								constantly doing a live stream though V live and creating music that connects them and the fans around the world. 
								<br><br>As a way to show gratitude, ARMYs around the world show their love and care for the boys every time they visit. 
								Through these simple projects, the fans says all the things that they  cannot say to BTS. Here are some of the most 
								unforgettable fan projects:
								<br><br>						
								<h4> BTS Live Trilogy Episode III: The Wings Tour (Bangkok, Thailand) </h4>
								<img src="img/portfolio/bts1.jpg"><br> Day 1 <br>
								<img src="img/portfolio/bts2.jpg"><br> Day 2 <br>
								<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TbrKstjxH1w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>
								<center><br><br>For the first day of the Wings tour in Thailand, ARMYs executed their fan project which was to show this line “방탄 이란 걸 믿 어” which means 
								 “We believe in Bangtan.” while BTS is performing 2!3!, a song BTS made for the fans.<br> In the 2nd day of the concert, the fans did another 
								 project which was to show the line “Be Ur Wings Forever” when BTS was performing the same song. This words act as a reply from this line in 
								 the song You Never Walk Alone, “I wanna fly, But I have no wings, But your hands become my wings”, stating that ARMYs will forever be with BTS 
								 as they soar the sky.<br><br><br><br>
								<h4>BTS Live Trilogy Episode III: The Wings Tour (Anaheim)</h4>
								<img src="img/portfolio/bts3.jpg"><br> Rainbow Colored Ocean<br><br><br><br>
								<h4>BTS 3rd Muster</h4>
								<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mWohGAAjDM0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
								<br><img src="img/portfolio/bts4.jpg"><br> <br>
								When BTS started performing 2!3! (Hoping For More Good Days), the K-ARMYs surprised the boys by turning the whole arena into a 
								purple ocean and sang along with them. Even when the music stopped playing, ARMYs' voices can still be heard throughout 
								the whole arena, proving just how passionate they are in showing how much they love Bangtan.<br><br><br><br>
								<h4>BTS LIVE Hwa Yang Yeon Hwa On Stage: Epilogue (Seoul, South Korea)</h4>
								<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XHFaXxjzu6o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
								<br><img src="img/portfolio/bts5.jpg"><br><br>
								On the first day of the Epilogue concert, the fans made a banner to show to the boys stating, “You will be my singer forever” 
								while singing I need U, the very first song of The Most Beautiful Moment In Life Trilogy.  During the 2nd day, the fans did 
								another project. A banner that states, “I will be your audience forever.”, explaining that ARMYs will never leave them. 
								Because of the fact that they come from a small company, BTS fears they may lose everything in a second but ARMYs prove 
								their loyalty by giving the boys as much love as they can.<br><br><br><br>
								<h4>BTS Live Trilogy Episode III: The Wings Tour (Bangkok, Thailand)</h4><h5>J-hope Project</h5>
								<img src="img/portfolio/bts6.jpg"><br><img src="img/portfolio/bts7.jpg"><br>
								 While the concert was happening, fans started to wave around these banners and flowers. This just proved how ARMYs appreciate each 
								 member in BTS. Their efforts obviously did not go to waste because J-Hope noticed and smiled upon seeing his face in the banner.<br><br><br><br>
								<h4>BTS LIVE Hwa Yang Yeon Hwa On Stage: Epilogue (Manila, Philippines)</h4>
								<img src="img/portfolio/bts8.jpg"><br><img src="img/portfolio/bts9.jpg"><br><img src="img/portfolio/bts10.jpg"><br><br>The biggest A.R.M.Y Bomb<br><br><br><br>
								<h4>BTS Live Trilogy Episode III: The Wings Tour (Jakarta, Indonesia)</h4>
								<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XNPatpZvkZI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
								While singing 2!3!, the fans changed the lyrics into “I love you. If i say one two three just say it. Only remember good memories and laugh. 
								Hold BTS hand and smile. There’s always more good days in the future. I believe in BTS, one two three. Believe, one two three”. <br><br><br><br>
								<h4>BTS Live Trilogy Episode III: The Wings Tour (Brazil)</h4>
								<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pw6lLqxSa14" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
								Each member in BTS have their solo song in their most recent album. As Rap Monster started singing his solo song, Reflection, the fans chanted and sang along with him. When he began to sing the part "I wish I could love myself", ARMYs replied to him saying, "We love you!" The following day, Rap Monster changed the line to "I do love myself." 💖💖💖

                                <p> Sistar is a South Korean girl group formed in 2010 by Starship Entertainment. The group consisted of Hyolyn, Bora, Soyou, and Dasom. According to one member, they named themselves Sistar because they will become big stars with a friendly image, just like a sister and Sistar definitely has the sisterly image, making all of their fans feel a sisterly bond with Sistar.
								<br>For many years, Sistar’s comebacks are one of the most awaited during summer because of their catch songs. However after 7 years of being a group, the 4 women decided to go to their own separate ways. Just this May, Starship Entertainment announced that Sistar will be disbanding after releasing a last song. Here are some of my favorite songs of Sistar that I will definitely miss seeing them perform:</p>

									Wenk. Wenk.<br><strong>One friend.</strong> It was evening when Allysa Antipala heard that signal. <br>She had been waiting with jumping feet under the tree that she and her friends agreed to meet.<br>This particular friend had a good voice.<br><br>
									Nakajima…<br><strong>Second.</strong> Oh, did Allysa miss her friends. This one in particular likes to bite her shoulders.<br><br>
									Munchkin is mine.<br><strong>Third.</strong>Allysa loved her for her unfailing high pitched voice.<br><br>
									He is my bae.<br><strong>Fourth.</strong> Allysa loved her for being an ultimate fan girl of chicken.<br><br><br>
									These were the signals that Allysa had waited.<br>And these signals have arrived. <hr><hr>
									This was made by Chine Malaque but I am the one who posted this because meeeehhhh, I just want to huehue.</p>
